## Cyclemeter Data

Simple [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app that uses cycling data recorded with [Cyclemeter](https://cyclemeter.com/), uploaded to Strava, and then downloaded as a CSV file (activities.csv). Plots ascent, calories, etc. vs. time, and also relative effort as analog and E-bike rides. Hosted [here](https://cyclemeter-4zvccteaqusorsnjrfetfq.streamlit.app/) on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
